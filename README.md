# dicom-visualizr

Visualises structure of DICOM objects (within files), so this is not a DICOM viewer. Instead of being used for study of the anatomy of human bodies, this tool can be used to study the anatomy of DICOM itself.

The project uses maven and will produce a "fat" JAR that can be run standalone.
